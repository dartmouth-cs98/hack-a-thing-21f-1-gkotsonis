# Massachusetts Realty Listing iOS App using React Native


## What you built? 

I attempted to build an ios app using react native that allows users to search for home listings within towns in Massachusetts (my home state). The opening screen has the search term defaulted to "Boston", but the user can input any town or city name. Once fully working, the app should display the top 50 listings (or however many there are in the town if less than 50 exist) and their addresses, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, and price.

## Who Did What?

I completed the entirety of this project, although it is unfinished. I have spent about 12 hours so far (most of that time has been spent reading documentation and troubleshooting annoying errors), and plan on taking more time to finish this. The biggest issue I am facing at the moment is that I initially created the project in a local directory and after copying the contents over to my github repo, ran into errors while trying to run the simulator. I am currently working on resolving this issue, but as a result, I have not been able to fully test some of the newer features I am attempting to add (like flatlist formatting of search results)

## What you learned

Through this hack-a-thing, I learned a great deal about JavaScript and React Native. I have worked a bit with JavaScript and React in the past, but mostly on existing codebases, so I have not had the experience of building a project from scratch. As a result, I feel much more confident in my ability to build a mobile or web app from the ground up. Additionally, I gained valuable insight into some of the differences between React and React Native. This project also forced me to read through much more documentation than I am used to doing, so I now feel more comfortable troubleshooting issues myself without having to ask for help from others. Apart from that, I gained greater insight into how to use and extract data from online APIs, as well as where to look to find information about different APIs.

## Acknowledgments

I began by following this tutorial https://www.raywenderlich.com/485-react-native-tutorial-building-ios-apps-with-javascript, but soon realized that much of the code (and the realty api) used in the tutorial are incompatible with newer versions of React Native and JavaScript libraries, so a solid chunk of this code was written by me.
